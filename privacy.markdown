We collect and utilize Other Information to optimize, secure and simplify your experience with us. Your Other Information is never disclosed or shared outside of plynty.
For All plynty Users and Clients
Your Browser or Device
Certain information is collected by most browsers or applications, such as your “user agent string”, to help us determine your computing device type, operating system version and Internet browser type and version. We use this information to ensure that our website(s) function properly and for security purposes.
Your Cookies
Like most web sites, plynty uses cookies and web log files to track site usage. A cookie is a tiny data file which resides on your computer which allows plynty to recognize you as a user when you return to our site using the same computer and web browser. Unfortunately, if your browser settings do not allow cookies, you will not be able to use our website. Like the information you enter at registration or in your Profile, cookie and log file data is used to customize your experience on the web site.
One type of cookie, known as a “persistent” cookie, is set once you've logged in to your plynty account. The next time you visit the plynty web site, the persistent cookie will allow us to recognize you as an existing user so you will not need to log in (using LinkedIn OAuth) before using the service. In order to access or change any of your private information (like a credit card number), however, you must log in securely again with your password even if your computer contains your persistent cookie. Additionally, if you log out of the plynty site you will need to re-enter your LinkedIn login credentials the next time you visit in order to log in to your account. Another type of cookie, called a “session” cookie, is used to identify a particular visit to the plynty site. Session cookies expire after a short time or when you close your web browser.
Due to the communications standards on the Internet, when you visit the plynty web site we automatically receive the URL of the site from which you came and the site to which you are going when you leave plynty. We also receive the Internet protocol (IP) address of your computer (or the proxy server you use to access the World Wide Web), your computer operating system and type of web browser you are using, as well as the name of your ISP. This information is used to analyze overall trends to help us improve the plynty service. The linkage between your IP address and your personally identifiable information is never shared with third-parties without your permission or except when required by law.
Your IP Address
Your IP Address is a number assigned to the device that you are using by your Internet Service Provider. An IP Address is identified and logged whenever you visit our website(s) or applications, along with the page(s) that were visited. We use IP Addresses for calculating usage levels, helping diagnose technical problems and supporting our website(s) and applications. Additionally, we use your IP Address to assist in fraud detection and authentication to better protect your security.
Pixels Tags
plynty deploys Pixel Tags as 1x1 pixel images (GIFs), used to track your access to web site pages, and HTML-formatted email messages. We use pixel tags to measure the effectiveness of our communications, the success of our marketing campaigns, compile statistics about usage and response rates, and to assist us in resolving client questions about the use of our services.
5. Further Information
For All plynty Users and Clients
To protect Personal Information from unauthorized access and use, we use security measures that comply with relevant laws and regulations. Beyond this Privacy & Security Statement, we provide additional security measures, such as:
Bank Level Security: plynty is powered using technologies and practices that many banks and other financial institutions use to protect customer information, such as SSL encryption for data in transit and AES encryption for sensitive data at rest. After initial account aggregation, we do not store your financial institution credentials in our systems or in our applications. Our dashboard account aggregation service is provided by an industry-leading third-party account aggregation service. (See “With Whom We Share Your Personal Information” above.) That service employs comprehensive financial data security standards and is subject to ongoing multi-agency financial institution regulatory examinations.
Device Authentication: When you register for our app, we recognize your device for enhanced security. If access to your account is attempted from another device, you will be notified by phone or email and access will not be granted unless you authorize the new device. Also, you may remove lost devices from your authorized device list to continuously protect from unauthorized access to your account.

Reviewing and Updating your Personally Identifiable Information
You can view and update the profile and account information we collect for you by going to the “settings” function in our website and in our app. The credibility and relevance of our services depend on your providing us with complete, accurate and up-to-date information about yourself and your accounts, both now and in the future.
Email Marketing Opt-out
When we communicate our own marketing offers to you, these communications are CAN-SPAM compliant, including the ability for you to opt-out of marketing communications.
Deletion/Retention of Personally Identifiable Information
Unless you request otherwise, we will retain the Personal Information we collect from you indefinitely.
Compendium, as a registered investment advisor, must comply with certain legal and regulatory requirements pertaining to record retention. We will respond to any requests we receive asking that we delete Personal Information that we possess from those who use our services, downloaded our App or registered and established a user profile. However, we will not delete information that we are required to retain in order to comply with applicable laws and regulations.
How to Request Deletion of the Personal Information We Collect.
You may visit the our FAQ page on our web site for instructions on how to delete your plynty account.
Alternatively, you may request your plynty account be deleted by emailing support@plynty.com from the email address associated with your plynty account, indicating “CANCEL” in the subject line of the message. After confirming you are the account owner we will remove Personal Information from our records and will only continue to retain such information as required by law.
plynty’s Statement Regarding “Do Not Track” Signals
Most browsers can be set to send signals to third party websites requesting them not to track the user’s activities. At this time, plynty does not respond to “do not track” signals. Consequently, plynty, its third party service providers such as Google Analytics, and other third party websites and online services may indeed track and collect Personal Information about your online activities over time while navigating to, from and on our website and our mobile app and across those third party websites and online services, notwithstanding any “do not track” signals we may receive.
Advertising
We do not allow 3rd party advertising on our website or applications.
Social Media
plynty may integrate authentication or social experiences on social media platforms such as Facebook®, Twitter®, Google Circles and LinkedIn® that enable login or online sharing and collaboration among users who have registered to use such social media platforms. Any content you post, such as pictures, information, opinions, or any Personal Information that you make available to other participants on these social platforms, is subject to the terms of use and privacy policies of those platforms. Please refer to them to better understand your rights and obligations with regard to such content.
Protecting Children’s Privacy Online
plynty is not directed to individuals under the age of thirteen (13), and those children should not provide Personal Information through our website(s) or applications. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13 without parental consent. For more information about the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), visit the Federal Trade Commission website.


Modifications to our Privacy Policy
We change our privacy practices from time to time as the need arises. When we do, we will revise this Privacy & Security Statement and we will post the revised document on our website at https://www.plynty.com/privacy-policy.
Legal Disclaimer:
It is possible that we may need to disclose personal information when required by law. We will disclose such information wherein we have a good-faith belief that it is necessary to comply with a court order, ongoing judicial proceeding, or other legal process served on our company or to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.
