#### Financial account aggregation
We offer financial account aggregation, where plynty, acting as your authorized agent, will retrieve your financial account information, such as your account 
balances, transactions and holdings, from financial institutions you designate. Financial account aggregation is an optional Service you may utilize by providing 
financial account credentials, allowing us to securely connect with third party financial institutions, to present your financial information to you in a useful 
fashion. Our account aggregation Services are regularly refreshed, providing you with up-to-date financial account information.  If you choose not to use the

### Disclaimers
By using our Services, you understand and acknowledge that the investment results you could obtain from investment information and financial insights provided by 
plynty cannot be guaranteed. All investments entail a risk of loss and you may lose money. You also understand that all investments are subject to various market, 
currency, economic, political, business and other risks. Investments, particularly those in international stocks and stocks of smaller companies, present numerous 
risks, can be very volatile and can result in a loss of principal. International investments include risks of currency fluctuation, political and economic instability 
and differences in financial reporting in addition to the risks present in domestic investments. Investments in smaller companies may involve greater risks than 
investments in larger, more mature companies. The value of debt securities (bonds) frequently is reduced (sometimes dramatically) by increases in interest rates. 

Your choice to receive our investment services are subject to your explicit enrollment and acceptance of a separate client agreement and related fee schedule; 
all such services are considered separate from the App and related Services defined within these Terms of Use. Please read the disclosure brochure, 
available at www.plynty.com/__________, which explains our  separate investmenting/wealth management service in more detail.

information maintained by third-party financial institutions with which you have a legally binding customer relationship (“Account Information”). Subject to our 
privacy procedures as described in the Privacy Statement, plynty may work with one or more third party financial service technology providers to access and 
retrieve your Account Information.

AND EVERY ACT AND THING REQUISITE AND NECESSARY TO BE DONE IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH ACTIVITIES, AS FULLY TO ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES AS YOU COULD DO IN PERSON.
YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT WHEN plynty IS ACCESSING AND RETRIEVING ACCOUNT INFORMATION FROM THIRD PARTY SITES, plynty IS ACTING AS YOUR AGENT, AND NOT AS THE AGENT 
OF OR ON BEHALF OF ANY THIRD PARTY. YOU AGREE THAT THIRD PARTY ACCOUNT PROVIDERS SHALL BE ENTITLED TO RELY ON THE FOREGOING AUTHORIZATION, AGENCY AND POWER OF 
ATTORNEY GRANTED BY YOU. You understand that the Services are not endorsed or sponsored by any third party account providers accessible through the Services.

### Your Registration Information

(“Personal Information”) that is collected on the secure enrollment page. See the Privacy Statement for further information.

### Your Electronic Disclosure Consent
By providing your email to enroll for use of our Services, you consent to receive all notices and information regarding plynty Services electronically. Electronic 
communications may be delivered through the plynty App and/or delivered to your registered e-mail address. All communications in electronic format will be considered 
to be in “writing,” and to have been received no later than five (5) business days after posting or dissemination, whether or not you have received or retrieved the 
communication. Your consent to receive communications electronically is valid until you end your relationship with plynty. It is your responsibility to provide us 
with true, accurate and complete e-mail addresses, contact and other information related to this disclosure and to maintain and update promptly any changes in this 
information. You may print a copy of any electronic communications and retain it for your records. We reserve the right to terminate or change the terms and 
conditions on which we provide electronic communications and will provide you notice thereof in accordance with applicable law.

### Risk Factors
Risk Factors 

In addition to the other important disclosures included throughout this Agreement, this subsection contains some of the key risk factors that you must consider when 
determining whether to become a plynty user. The following list does not purport to be an exhaustive list and cannot be a complete list of all possible risk factors. 

i. Currently, our recommendations are appropriate only for investors with medium-term and long-term investment horizons, specifically two years or more, before such 
investors plan to access assets that are invested pursuant to our recommendations.
 
ii. Investing in securities involves risk, including the risk that you could lose your entire investment.
 
iii. While our algorithms are designed to meet the stated investment objectives, there is no certainty that such investment objectives will be met through 
implementation of the recommendations.
 
iv. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This should go without saying but most people seem to continue to believe that the past is highly relevant.

v. Our recommendations are completely reliant on the accuracy of the information provided to us by our clients. If a client were to provide us with inaccurate 
information, this could materially impact the quality and applicability of our recommendations. 

vi. Our recommendations are highly reliant on the accurate performance of the Algorithms and the technology that generates these Algorithms. A malfunction or failure 
in either could cause you to experience losses, some or all of which could be significant. 
vii. The Algorithms employ a number of quantitative models that involve assumptions based upon a limited number of variables that may be extracted from complex 
financial markets or instruments that they intend to replicate. Any one or all of these assumptions, whether or not supported by past experience, could prove over time 
to be incorrect, which could result in major losses.
 
viii. The recommendations we provide and other information that appears on our website may be time sensitive, especially during times of significant market volatility 
and when there are time limits on the availability of a particular investment product. Thus, our recommendations and other information on our website may be subject to 
different interpretations as market conditions and other factors change. 

ix. While our recommendations include a component that seeks to achieve tax efficient asset placement, this component is only one of many that comprise an individual’s 
comprehensive tax management plan and supplementary tax advice that is outside the scope of the services we provide may be necessary to minimize the impact of tax 
liabilities you could incur. 

x. We rely on third parties – often to a material extent – for the provision of market statistics, certain of the Client Information, fund details, performance and related 
information. Although we believe these third party service providers are generally reliable, there could be errors that are beyond our control in the information and/or 
services they provide and such errors could compromise the quality of our recommendations and otherwise compromise our ability to perform under this Agreement. Further, 
some or all of these agreements may allow the third party service provider to terminate the agreement for any reason or no reason at all with no advance notice to us. 
In such instances, our ability to perform under this Agreement could be materially compromised. 

### Cost of Service
Your use of the plynty App is subject to a monthly subscription fee. You may also choose additional services, such as investment and wealth management services 
provided by Compendium. plynty reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to amend or change it pricing policy for its current Services or any additional services that 
we may offer.

#### Data and Data Integrity
The overall integrity and quality of the data presented by plynty to you is an important element in providing you with a high quality and accurate picture of your 
personal finances. plynty, however, is not responsible for and cannot guarantee the accuracy or timeliness of Account Information we retrieve on your behalf directly, 
from third party technology providers, from third party financial institutions where your accounts are held, or from third party research/market data providers used to 
provide the Services.

plynty may not be able foresee or anticipate technical or other difficulties which may result in failure to obtain data, personalization settings or other service 
interruptions. plynty assumes no responsibility for the timeliness, accuracy, deletion, non-delivery or failure to store any user data, loss of user data, communications 
or personalization settings. plynty encourages you to periodically confirm the valuation or execution price of particular investments through independent sources, 
such as an investment adviser, broker-dealer or other financial institution.

in the case of claims by third parties against you, and at your expense in the case of claims for which we have the right to be indemnified by you, to assume 
the exclusive defense and control of any such claim, and you agree that in any event no such claim can be settled without our written consent.
